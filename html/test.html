            <p>Adore is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins 
                (vocalist Billy Corgan pictured), released on June 2, 1998, by Virgin Records. 
                After the multi-platinum success of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and subsequent tour, 
                the Pumpkins' follow-up album was highly anticipated, but drummer Jimmy Chamberlin had left the band, 
                and the recording of Adore was challenging. The album featured a more subdued and electronica-tinged
                 sound than the band's previous work; Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine called it "a complete break 
                 with the past". Sales for the album were far less than for the band's previous two albums, but it
                  became the third straight Pumpkins album to be nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative 
                  Music Performance. It was well received by critics, and has gained a cult following. A remastered and
                   expanded version of the album was released on CD, 
                vinyl and other formats in September 2014.</p>
